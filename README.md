## About
Our first example project using Unreal's First Person template as we dive into learning C++ in Unreal. 

We'll also cover some of the setup steps needed for using Rider with Unreal.

Knowledge of C++ fundamentals, as well as a basic knowledge of the Unreal Engine interface, are required to fully understand the material covered in this tutorial. The goal of these tutorials is not to learn how to code in C++. Instead it's to teach you how to script in the Unreal Engine using C++, while teaching you Epic's changes and additions to the language that are specific to working with the engine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tutorial was completed with and will only address issues using:
>* Windows 11
>* Unreal Engine 5.3.2
>* Rider 2023.3.4
